						<h3>Anthropogenic marine debris pollution</h3>
						<p class="imgcap"><img src="../img/oyster_pipe_debris.jpg">Anthropogenic marine debris (AMD) has been recognized as a major contaminant of global environmental and economic concern in the present age. A large amount of debris is released into the world’s oceans every year, and the total amount of debris released into the oceans from 1950 until 2015 was estimated at 150 million tons. My strong interest is in two aspects of AMD: (1) the effects of them on natural ecosystems and (2) the interaction between people’s consciousness and beach AMD. For (1), I am interested in the effects of AMD accumulation in the natural environment both on living things in the ecosystem and on an abiotic condition where novel ecosystems occur. For (2), studies about beach debris and their cleaning are a very popular activity in countermeasure of environmental issues even though the amount visible beach debris is relatively small compared to the total amount of existing AMD. I would like to explore and discover various answers to the question “Why do people tackle studying and cleaning beach debris?”.</p>
