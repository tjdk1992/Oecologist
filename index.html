					<h2>My background</h2>
					<p>I am an early-career researcher in ecology and area studies based in Kyoto. Currently, I am working as a project researcher for the LINKAGE project at the Research Institute for Humanity and Nature (RIHN) which project aims at developing adaptive governance of limited multi-resources related to the water cycle in linkage between land and sea and enhancing regional resilience to local and global environmental stressors in tropical coral islands in the pacific ocean. I play the role of knowledge bridging among units with different fields of study as a project member, as well as studying the impact of environmental degradation on the fish community in various habitats by using environmental DNA analysis as an independent researcher.

Previously, I worked as a post-doc researcher on some projects at Osaka University and Kyoto University, where I acquired specific skills including statistical analysis in natural and social science,  machine learning including text mining by natural language processing and object detection by deep learning, and communication among stakeholders of local environmental issues as I was engaging to institutional research, marine pollution study, and environmental education.

I completed my Master's degree and Ph.D. at Kyoto University dealing with the effects of the biological invasion of non-native cichlid fishes in the Chao Phraya River delta, Thailand. From the ecological and human-dimensional perspectives of their invasion, I evaluated the impact of the non-native fishes on the native ecosystem by analyzing the community and diversity of fish assemblage and food web and I also investigated their cultural use in the context of both self-consumption and commercial use by local residents.</p>

					<h2>Research interests</h2>
						<h3>Exotic species in novel ecosystems</h3>
						<p><strong>Novel Ecosystem</strong> is defined as ”a system of abiotic, biotic and social components (and their interactions) that, by virtue of human influence, differ from those that prevailed historically, having a tendency to self-organize and manifest novel qualities without intensive human management (Hobbs  et al. 2006)”. This concept has been invited a lot of criticism, particularly, from researchers in the field of invasion biology and biodiversity conservation because some researchers believe that all altered ecosystems could be restored into original condition. From my standpoint, I am expecting that the Novel Ecosystem is not a concept to discard historical (native) ecosystems, but it suggests that the types of ecosystems composing a landscape could be more diversified by combining historical and novel ecosystems. My strong interest is in how exotic species interact with other organisms and social components and how they are recognized by local people in the landscape composed by both historical and novel ecosystems.</p>
