					<h2>My background</h2>
					<p>I obtained my PhD from the Graduate School of Asian and African Area Studies at Kyoto University in 2020, Kyoto, where I studied the ecological and socioeconomic impact of exotic cichlid fishes introduced in the Chao Phraya River basin, Thailand. In the study for the thesis, I analyzed feeding habits of exotic cichlid fishes by stomach contents and stable isotope analysis and effects on fish communities by multivariate analysis and suggested the negative impact of the fishes is small and they invaded into an empty niche. Additionally, I conducted interview surveys to local people who use fish for their self-consumption and people who sell and buy fresh fish in local markets and revealed that the cichlid fishes are important food resources in the area, indicating they could provide provisioning ecosystem services. After submitting PhD thesis about exotic cichlid fishes in the anthropogenic landscape, my research interests have involved novel ecosystems formed by irreversible anthropogenic alteration of the ecosystem’s abiotic conditions and biotic composition and human-nature interaction generated among the novel ecosystem and local people. Nowadays, deriving from such interests, I am challenging novel methods such as iEcology and Conservation Culturomics to answer research questions in ecology and to gain insights into biodiversity conservation.</p>

					<h2>Research interests</h2>
						<h3>Exotic species in novel ecosystems</h3>
						<p><strong>Novel Ecosystem</strong> is defined as ”a system of abiotic, biotic and social components (and their interactions) that, by virtue of human influence, differ from those that prevailed historically, having a tendency to self-organize and manifest novel qualities without intensive human management (Hobbs  et al. 2006)”. This concept has been invited a lot of criticism, particularly, from researchers in the field of invasion biology and biodiversity conservation because some researchers believe that all altered ecosystems could be restored into original condition. From my standpoint, I am expecting that the Novel Ecosystem is not a concept to discard historical (native) ecosystems, but it suggests that the types of ecosystems composing a landscape could be more diversified by combining historical and novel ecosystems. My strong interest is in how exotic species interact with other organisms and social components and how they are recognized by local people in the landscape composed by both historical and novel ecosystems.</p>
